for the dataset ‘salary.csv’ using the above model. Display the training and testing dataset in the
scatter plot and draw the best fit line in the same. Also find the MSE and R2 for the testing
dataset.

Question 5
Consider the dataset california_housing from sklearn . Find the correlation b/w the different
attributes of this dataset. Using the least square estimation method from sklearn, find the best fit
line. Also find the error.

Question 6
Consider the dataset ‘Adveristing.csv’. Find the correlation coefficient between the input
attributes TV, Radio, Newspaper and Output Attribute Sales. Use least square estimation
method to find the line of regression b/w
