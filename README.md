[Lab Assignment - 1](MSc_ML_Lab_1.ipynb) : Apply Decision Tree Classification to the dataset mentioned in the given notebook. Record the accuracy, precision, recall, and f1-score when the data is:

1. Not scaled/ normalized
2. scaled but not oversampled
3. scaled and oversampled

Repeat the same on another dataset from the UCI repository for the binary classification problem.

[Lab Assignment - 2](MSc_ML_Lab_2.ipynb) : Implement two algorithms:
